# Tracking statistics for high-denomination euro banknotes

## Banknotes in circulation versus practical use

The euro has seven banknote denominations: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euro.

Official circulation data indicates that the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 euro notes are most common [1].
The 200 and 500 euro notes are less common relative to the other denominations, but together
they still make up roughly 3% of all Euro banknotes in circulation.

| 5 euro | 10 euro | 20 euro | 50 euro | 100 euro | 200 euro| 500 euro|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.2% | 10.1% | 16.1% | 49.1% | 13.5% | 2.0% | 1.0% | 

The circulation data seems to differ from how the denominations are used
in practice in some countries. For example, in The Netherlands, only the 5, 10, 20 and 50 euro
notes are in everyday use in most areas. These lower-denomination notes are available in ATMs and generally accepted by
shops. In a 2021 survey, the Dutch national bank (DNB) found that a majority of respondents
had never held a 200 euro note and/or a 500 euro note [2]. Although a majority had held a 100 euro
note, most people did not have one in the past year.

This begs the question where all of these high-denomination notes are, if people use them only
rarely. This document uses data from https://eurobilltracker.com to show in which countries high-denomination
euro banknotes are reportedly used most frequently, both relative to low-denomination notes and
in absolute numbers. The repository also contains the processed data and scripts that were used
to create the graphs and tables.
